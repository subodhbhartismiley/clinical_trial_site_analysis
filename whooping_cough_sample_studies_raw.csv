In Africa alone it is estimated that there are 2.1 million cases and 542,000 deaths from pertussis in infants under 1 year with the highest rates of morbidity and mortality in infants \<3 months old, before possible prevention via the infant immunization programme1. To protect these most vulnerable infants, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends Tdap vaccination as safe in pregnancy and recommends the use of wP vaccines within the EPI. Maternal antibody following aP vaccination can interfere with infant anti-pertussis antibody responses post infant EPI vaccination, which is of concern in high burden settings such as Uganda. There are therefore multiple factors in this population which may influence the effect of pertussis immunization in pregnancy, and which have not been studied, most notably HIV infection and interference with wP vaccines in infants. The immunogenicity of Tdap in HIV-infected pregnant women has not yet been examined. In addition, to date, the effect of maternal vaccination, placental transfer and infant antibody responses in HEU infants have not been studied at all. There are no studies examining the immune response to wP vaccine administered to infants (EPI recommendation) whose mothers received aP in pregnancy.","Inclusion Criteria:

Since the WHA resolution, all countries that were solely using OPV have either introduced Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) into their routine immunization schedule or decided to introduce IPV but have been unable to secure supply. The global demand for IPV has therefore substantially increased in just a few years. Many initiatives are ongoing to meet the increasing demand for IPV. One potential approach is the reduction of the amount of antigen per vaccine dose. Therefore, to enhance the affordability, effectiveness and accessibility of IPV.

SIIPL has manufactured hexavalent combination vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b and a reduced dose of three IPV antigens.

Based on available published data, reduction of the antigen content of each of the three poliovirus types in IPV is feasible, without substantially compromising the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Advantages of a reduction in antigen content are two-fold: increased availability of IPV and reduced cost, both of major importance for the global eradication programme.","Inclusion Criteria:

This study will contribute to children's health by: (1) providing updated guidelines to better define the prevalence of ID/IDA in early infancy, and its safe and effective control using iron; and (2) providing a new approach to improve response to pediatric vaccines in LMIC, by ensuring adequate iron status at time of vaccination.","Inclusion Criteria:

The control group will receive a standard dose licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine at day 1, and an active-comparator (Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine) at day 180. Participants in the experimental group will receive the same influenza vaccine at day 1 and day 180. Endpoints are immunological, and include measures of haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titres, micro-neutralisation titres and cell-mediated immunity at 4 time points after the initial vaccination up to Day 360. The primary hypothesis is that participants receiving an influenza booster at day 180 will achieve superior influenza seroprotection (HI titre ≥1:40) at day 208, compared to controls.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the global annual burden from seasonal influenza as 1 billion infections, with 3-5 million severe cases and 300,000-500,000 deaths. The pattern and impact of these infections varies considerably with climate. In temperate countries, influenza epidemics characteristically occur during the cold winter months, while in sub-tropical countries, they coincide with the rainy seasons. Closer to the equator, influenza virus activity is more complex. In Singapore, biannual epidemics are usual, but with continuous transmission year-round. Bi-annual epidemics, tri-annual epidemics and year round virus activity have also been described in other tropical countries, from Indonesia and Malaysia to Peru and Mexico.

There is no published data reporting year-round influenza vaccine effectiveness in the elderly from countries with continuous influenza virus activity. Despite numerous studies worldwide exploring the HI antibody response to influenza vaccination, the majority of these do not continue follow up beyond seroconversion (21-28 days). However, of the few available, HI antibody titres declined following influenza vaccination in the elderly, such that within 6-12 months geometric mean titres approached pre-vaccination levels. With biannual epidemics and year-round transmission in tropical regions, year-round seroprotection may be important to reduce influenza infections in this environment. A six-monthly vaccination cycle would correspond with the decline in vaccine-induced seroprotection in the elderly, and the 6-monthly periodicity of outbreaks in Singapore and other tropical countries.","Inclusion Criteria:

Both have advantages and disadvantages: The acellular form (aP, mainly used in resource-rich countries) does not appear to offer as long lasting protection, but the whole cell vaccine (wP, mainly used in LMIC) appears to be generally more reactogenic. There is consensus that a ""better pertussis vaccine"" ought to be designed.

The GaPs trial is part of a series of clinical trials performed by the PERtussIS COrrelates of Protection Europe (PERISCOPE) Consortium, an EU-funded group of investigators which aims to generate knowledge on immune responses to pertussis. A better understanding of human biomarkers of protective immune responses to B. pertussis and its waning immunity is needed to accelerate the design and testing of new pertussis vaccines with a longer duration of protection.

This proposal describes the design and objectives of the clinical trial to be conducted in the Gambia, which is the only site in Africa involved in the consortium and involves the recruitment of 600 mother/infant pairs. Pregnant women will be randomised to receive either the usually recommended tetanus vaccination or a combination vaccine against whooping cough, diptheria, tetanus and polio. Their infants will receive either aP or wP as part of their EPI vaccines, and resulting immune responses will be characterized in detail up to the age of 9 months. The investigators will use immunological assays to investigate the functional humoral and cellular responses to pertussis in infants born to mothers who are randomized to receiving pertussis vaccine in pregnancy or not, and their infants who will receive either aP or wP vaccine.

Our research questions are:

Does vaccination against pertussis in pregnancy have impact on subsequent immune responses to pertussis vaccine and other EPI vaccines in the infants Does vaccination of infants with wP vaccine induce different levels and functionality of antibody and/or T cell responses than vaccination with aP vaccine What is the difference in innate and acquired immunity- as measured with novel systems vaccinology tools- between being vaccinated with wP versus aP?","Inclusion Criteria:

The main difference of the novel Coronavirus is the higher mortality rate, that is around 3%.

Death rate is over 1% only for patients over 50 years old, whereas until 40 years old is under 0,4%. No fatalities are declared among children under 10 years old to date. Death rate is almost double for male rather than female. This distribution of mortality rate according to age of infected patients could be only partially ascribed to other comorbidities in addition to great age. In fact, patients with no pre-existing conditions have however a case fatality rate of 0,9%.

The almost null rate of severe illness in children and generally in patients younger than 40 years old is quite un-explicable. Infant, children and young people could be infected but infection is rapidly self-limited or without symptoms. Older patients undergo severe lung injury as consequence of an immune response that is late in coming.

Possible explanation of these phenomena could be something, which assure ability to prompt response to SARS-CoV-2 in younger people independently from the novelty of the virus itself.

It would seem to be that younger people are already sensitized to the antigens of the virus without a previous contact.

This immunity is not really specific, but ""partially specific"" for many antigens of the virus, however able to limit the infection in the organism. Something stimulated the immune system and it scattered immunity against more and more antigens present. Children are the age group mostly exposed to all community-circulating viruses.

This immunity is not persistent but progressively fade out. It protects from the age of two, when the hypothetical stimulation occurs, to the fifth decade because of its slow decrease.

The only external stimulation, which healthy people receive are vaccines. All vaccinations and especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis could stimulate immune system. They develop the specific immunity but generate also a sprouting immunity against antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other community-circulating viruses.

The developed immunity gives some protection against multiple viral infection for years until the natural fade out.

After the fifth decade, that immunity is slower to be recall and reactivated. Additionally, transplant recipients and HIV infected patients, which have an immune system inhibited, unexpectedly, do not seem to suffer the worst complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. An immune system imbalance could be play a pivotal role during the reaction to the virus, limiting destructive consequences of excessive inflammation.

According to the medical hypothesis on which the protocol is based on, young people could benefit from a functional adaptation of innate immune cells induced through epigenetic reprogramming and, especially, a pre-existing ""partially specific"" immunity to the community viruses caused by ""bystander effect"" of preceding vaccinations. In this study, we will explore the main differences existing among patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 who experience the illness at different degree of severity. We suppose to recognize different populations of patients, each one with a specific immunological pattern. It could differ in terms of cytokines, soluble factors serum level and immune cells activity both of the innate compartment and of the acquired one. The proof of a role of these immunological phenomena in the pathogenesis of Covid-19 are bases for implementation of therapeutic immunomodulatory treatments. In addition, the definition of an immunological risk profile could tailor established therapies to each kind of patient.","Inclusion Criteria:

This resurgence is considered as resulting from the limited durability of aP-vaccine-induced immunity and is associated with increased mortality in young infants and morbidity at all age groups. As the pertussis immunity acquired through immunization or infection is short-lived, its maintenance or reactivation requires repeat boosting at regular time points. Thus, novel strategies capable of reactivating pertussis immunity are needed.

The efficacy of current acellular pertussis vaccines (which contain chemically-detoxified pertussis toxoid (PT)) rapidly wanes, in part because priming and repeat immunization with acellular vaccines induce antibodies specific for the chemically-detoxified PT but unable to efficiently recognize the native PT expressed by B. pertussis.

Clinical studies have shown the superior immunogenicity profile of acellular pertussis vaccines including genetically-detoxified PT (rPT) in adults and adolescents previously primed with aP. In particular, the investigators showed in a past Geneva study in teenagers previously primed with aP that rPT/FHA induced a stronger recall response than the current aP-vaccine at one month post-vaccination. However, the difference was less clear one year after vaccination, suggesting that 2 doses may be needed for more sustained immunity.

In the present study, the investigators would like to assess whether giving two doses of rPT/FHA at 6 months interval induces stronger immune responses than a single dose.","Inclusion Criteria:

This evaluation is the first of its kind in the nation and may have a profound impact on prevention.

AFIX has four major components: 1) Assessment of a provider's current immunization practices and vaccination levels, 2) Feedback of the assessment results and strategies to improve coverage levels, 3) Incentives to improve coverage levels, and 4) eXchange of information and resources necessary to facilitate improvement.

This program will evaluate the effectiveness of AFIX visits on affecting provider practices to increase adolescent (age 11-18) immunization. Visits include discussion of that practice's immunization rates and strategies for improving rates. The investigators will compare the changes, from baseline to 5 months, in immunization for practices receiving virtual visits (webinars), in-person visits, and no visits (control group). Thirty practices will be randomly assigned to each intervention type. The main outcomes of this study are practice-wide uptake rates of several adolescent vaccines (Tdap, HPV, and MCV4) as well as pre- and post-AFIX visit surveys focusing on recall tactics utilized by each practice.

Although notification of vaccine-preventable diseases is mandatory, very often the etiologic agents causing VPDs are not identified the etiological agents causing the major and most severe infectious diseases in childhood. Several reasons underlie the underestimation. For example, not having a good surveillance system does not allow us to organize a sustainable prevention project for example based on on the introduction of new vaccinations.

Some NICU graduates can be classified as children with special health care needs (CSHCN) who will require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally. NICU parents report increased anxiety and stress during their stay and transition home from the NICU. Short-term peer-to -peer programs during hospitalization decrease stress, anxiety and depression for mothers, however, no studies have evaluated the effects of long term post-discharge peer support. Children's National (CN) provides medical home services to CSHCN through its Parent Navigator Program (PNP). Parent Navigators (PNs) are CSHCN parents who provide peer emotional support, access to community resources, and assistance with navigating complicated health systems. NICU graduates and their caregivers may benefit from support provided by PNs after discharge. No data regarding the impact of PNs on patient and family outcomes of the NICU graduate are available.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a PNP on a parent's self-efficacy, stress, anxiety, depression; infant health care utilization, and immunization status.

METHODS: 300 NICU graduates will be randomized to receive either PN for 12 months (intervention group) or usual care (comparison group). Baseline data at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge will be collected from caregivers in both groups including scales for self-efficacy, stress, anxiety, and depression, infant healthcare utilization and immunization status. Outcomes will be compared at 12 months.

PATIENT OUTCOMES (PROJECTED) The study outcomes are parental self-efficacy, stress, anxiety, and depression; infant health care utilization and immunization status.

ANTICIPATED IMPACT Prior studies utilizing small samples have suggested that peer support in the NICU can reduce anxiety and depression in caregivers. It is unclear whether peer support after discharge, when a family is faced with the total care of their child without structured supports, can significantly impact parents' ability to care for their child. The investigators anticipate that this simple intervention will increase self-efficacy in caregivers, reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, in turn resulting in improved health outcomes for their child.","Inclusion Criteria:

Infants also routinely receive a meningococcal group C vaccine (MenC) at 3 and 4 months and a 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar13) at 2 and 4 months of age. This study aims to offer infants a 6-in-1 vaccine (Infanrix-Hexa)that also helps protect against hepatitis B alongside the other routine vaccinations in the UK infant immunisation schedule and assess their immune responses to the different vaccines. Hepatitis B virus infects the liver and usually affects adults, but children can be infected through close contact with carriers of the virus. Children with hepatitis B infection may not have symptoms for many years but may go on to develop liver failure, cirrhosis and cancer. Many other countries already use Infanrix-Hexa and this study is being undertaken to help decide whether the UK can do the same. Babies taking part in this study will receive Infanrix-Hexa instead of Pediacel. All other vaccines given will be the same as in the routine schedule but will include one MenC vaccine instead of 2 doses because the UK infant immunisation schedule is soon going to change so that all babies will receive only one MenC vaccine at 3 months of age.

There are currently several licensed MenC vaccines that can be given to babies. In order to check whether there are differences in protection, babies taking part will randomly receive one of 3 MenC-containing vaccines: NeisVacC, Menjugate or Menitorix. Studies have already shown that one dose of Neis-Vac or Menjugate given to babies at 3 months provides similar protection against MenC infection as two doses given at 3 and 4 months. Menitorix protects against both Hib and MenC, so babies in the group receiving MenitorixTM will have an extra dose of Hib which is also included in Infanrix-Hexa but might have a lower antibody response to MenC compared to the other two MenC vaccines, although all infants should be well-protected after their 12-month booster vaccinations, which also contain Menitorix.","Inclusion Criteria

The stimulus it gives to the immune system allows it to respond more effectively to a subsequent infection with TB.

Many studies have shown that BCG is effective in reducing deaths from TB disease, particularly in children. However, there is also evidence that in countries with a relatively high death rate, BCG reduces this death rate but by more than would be expected by its effect on TB alone. This controversial but important finding warrants further and serious consideration. One possibility is that BCG, in addition to stimulating the immune system against TB, also has a positive effect on the way the immune system works more generally. This might mean a more effective response to serious infections that are completely unrelated to TB, or the ability to respond better to other routine childhood vaccines, or to maintain such responses for longer. In these examples, the timing of BCG administration in relation to other vaccines could be crucial.

This study will recruit 30 healthy babies who would not routinely be offered the BCG vaccine in the UK within the first week of life. Babies will be assigned at random to one of three groups of ten babies each. BCG will be given to one group of babies around birth, one at three months old and the last group will not get BCG during the study. Babies will stay in the study until 13 months old and have five blood tests over this period.

A Prospective, Randomised, Clinical Trial.",COMPLETED,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,"Prospective, Single-blind, Clinical, Trial, Intervention",4262,2012-09,2015-01,All-cause Hospitalisations,"In high-income societies the use of health care and medication is steadily increasing. Children have high morbidity, many visits at the general practitioner, an increasing number of hospitalisations, and an increasing use of medication. And, when children are ill, someone has to stay home to care for them. An un-explained global increase in the incidence of the allergic diseases eczema, wheezing, asthma and allergies means that 25% of high-income populations are affected. Cheap preventive measures are highly warranted. Recent studies have shown a positive, non-specific effect of early Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) immunisation on neonatal mortality in low-income countries and suggested a positive, non-specific effect on allergic disease in high-income countries. ""Non-specific"" means that the vaccine effect goes beyond prevention of the targeted disease, i.e. the BCG vaccine benefits the health status of the immunised individual in ways unrelated to protection against tuberculosis (TB). For instance, in a recent randomised trial in West Africa the investigators showed that the BCG vaccine at birth was safe in low birth weight (LBW) infants and significantly reduced neonatal mortality in these children, with a significant long-lasting effect on infant mortality in the smallest newborns with a birth weight \<1.5 kg. There is an urgent need to explore the huge potential of the BCG's beneficial immune-stimulatory effects among children in high-income populations.

Therefore, the investigators will carry out a large prospective randomised clinical trial in Denmark primarily designed to test the hypothesis that infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth experience 20% fewer hospitalisations during early childhood.

Secondary outcomes

1. To test the hypothesis that infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth are prescribed less antibiotics during early childhood than non-BCG-immunised infants.
2. To test the hypothesis that Danish infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth develop less eczema, asthmatic bronchitis/wheeze and food allergy at 3 and 12 months of age: self-reported, diagnosed by a physician, or found at clinical examination; and are prescribed less anti-eczema/asthma/allergy medication during early childhood than non-BCG-immunised infants.
3. To test the hypothesis that infants who receive the BCG at birth respond in paraclinical measures: Specific IgE, thymic gland size, leucocyte count and differentiation, monocyte memory, cytokine profiles, and antibody titres following immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, pneumococcus, hemophilus.
4. To test the hypothesis that infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth respond in growth measures: weight, length and head circumference.
5. To test the hypothesis that infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth respond with decreased morbidity: common cold, pneumonia, febrile episodes, diarrhoea and vomiting, acute otitis media, febrile convulsions.
6. To test the hypothesis that premature infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks who get the BCG vaccine at birth have unaffected psychomotor development measures: Ages and Stages scores.
7. To test the hypothesis that infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth has unaffected coverage with the subsequent vaccinations in the Child Vaccination Programme.
8. To test the above mentioned hypotheses specifically in the strata of premature and low-birth-weight Danish infants.","Inclusion Criteria:

Rapid diagnosis of RTIs is essential as it drives decision points such as treatment, disposition, and containment. According to recent CDC (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) updates, nasopharyngeal swabbing is the preferred method of specimen collection for most RTIs such as SARS-COV-2. This process is invasive and traumatizing for patients as it requires probing (20 seconds) of the posterior nasopharynx with swab applicator. In some cases, this procedure has resulted in pain and injury. Because of the invasive nature of the procedure, patients often refuse testing or withdraw during the collection process resulting in inadequate specimen procurement. The study principle investigators (PI) have developed 2 novel specimen collection devices: 1) nasopharyngeal wash collection device (NP wash device) and 2) saliva collection device (the Oral Capsule). Both devices are designed for ease of use either by a healthcare professional or a patient. The benefits of such collection devices include 1) minimizing the invasive nature of the procedure because a swab applicator is not utilized and 2) minimizing infection risk to healthcare professional because the study devices can be self-administered when applicable. The study will enroll 1000 participants from a pool of patients presenting to the Nebraska Medicine Emergency Department (ED) who received a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab viral PCR test as part of their ED work up. Enrolled patients will be asked to provide four total specimens: 1) a saliva drool specimen, 2) a saliva Oral Capsule specimen, 3) a NP wash specimen, and 4) a finger stick serum specimen.

HS is a unique pediatric primary care-based program that helps families identify and manage parenting challenges. The program interweaves the medical support of the pediatrician's office with the resources and services of a HS Specialist trained to help parents understand their infants' needs (e.g., feeding, behavior, sleep) and their role as caregivers. HS Specialists provide enhanced educational support and facilitate targeted referrals to other relevant DoD and civilian support resources.

OBJECTIVE: The HS program has not been widely implemented or evaluated previously in a military context. However, a small 2-site pilot was initiated in 2017 by MC\&FP to assess the feasibility of offering the HS program in military treatment facilities (MTF). The Defense Health Agency (DHA) further determined that this pilot program could be expanded to fulfill a 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requirement for the implementation and evaluation of a pilot program to reduce risk factors for child abuse and neglect within the U.S. military community.

APPROACH: This outcome evaluation study entailed a review of medical records for families enrolled in the HS pilot as well as the collection of prospective survey data. Survey data collected from primary caregivers enrolled in HS at seven implementation locations throughout the U.S. is being compared with survey data collected from caregivers of newborns seeking care at control locations offering pediatric treatment as usual.

VALUE: The HS program is expected to improve parental engagement in well-baby care, increase targeted screenings and referrals, improve parental efficacy and knowledge, as well as facilitate integration and utilization of existing family services available across disparate military support settings. It also is expected to increase military service satisfaction and perceived support among military parents. Summary reports of study results will be provided to MC\&FP, DHA, and Congress.

RESEARCH COLLABORATORS: NHRC is a Department of the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery research command located in San Diego, California. Abt Global is a leading civilian professional research corporation with extensive experience in military health research. Investigators from these two institutions are collaborating to conduct this outcome evaluation.

STUDY POPULATION: Participating pilot program clinics included 7 military pediatric clinic locations selected by DHA and serving personnel and their families from all U.S. military service branches. All families with children aged 0-4 months seeking well-baby care at participating MTF pilot pediatric clinics were eligible for HS program services and for study recruitment. Additionally, beneficiaries similarly seeking care for a newborn at 11 MTF pediatric clinics providing treatment as usual were eligible for the comparison condition. Medical records for this population were reviewed and prospective survey evaluation data were collected and merged together for ongoing analysis and reporting.","Inclusion Criteria:

Vaccination of pregnant women with whooping cough vaccine in the third trimester of pregnancy was instigated nationally, so that antibodies produced by the Mum would cross the placenta to the unborn child, giving them passive protection at the most vulnerable time. This antibody transfer has been known for some time but has not been compared between the two whooping cough vaccines being used in pregnancy. Any effect the raised antibody might have on infant responses to the vaccines given in the first few months of life has also not been measured. This is particularly important as the infant immunisations include some of the same components as the whooping cough vaccines, which include diphtheria, tetanus and polio. Previous studies have shown that high levels of antibody prior to vaccination may affect subsequent antibody responses. It is therefore important to assess whether administration of the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy adversely affects the protection afforded by the infant vaccines, particularly to those which are similar, namely tetanus and diphtheria as well as meningitis C and Hib vaccines which include diptheria and tetanus components in their structures. This study will assess immune responses of mothers and their babies (\~200 pairs) to their vaccinations and will allow the comparison of two whooping cough vaccines being used in pregnancy. This will be done by taking small amounts of blood, which is the only way to measure antibody levels (the proxy of the immune response), before and after the vaccinations. A group of unvaccinated women and their babies (50 pairs) will also be recruited to allow comparison of their immune responses.","Inclusion Criteria:

The evolution of multi-drug resistant pathogens may be encouraged by provider prescribing behavior. Inappropriate use of antibiotics for nonbacterial infections and overuse of broad spectrum antibiotics can lead to the development of resistant strains. Though providers are adequately trained to know when antibiotics are and are not comparatively effective, this has not been sufficient to affect critical provider practices.

The intent of this study is to apply behavioral economic theory to reduce the rate of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory diagnoses for which guidelines do not call for antibiotics. Specifically targeted are infections that are likely to be viral.

The objective of this study is to improve provider decisions around treatment of acute respiratory infections.

The participants are practicing attending physicians or advanced practice nurses (i.e. providers) at participating clinics who see acute respiratory infection patients. A maximum of 550 participants will be recruited for this study.

Providers consenting to participate will fill out a baseline questionnaire online. Subsequent to baseline data collection and enrollment, participating clinic sites will be randomized to the study arms, as described below.

There will be a control arm, with clinic sites randomized in a multifactorial design to up to three interventions that leverage the electronic medical record: Order Sets that are triggered by electronic health record (EHR) workflow containing exclusively guideline concordant choices (SA, for Suggested Alternatives); Accountable Justifications triggered by discordant prescriptions that populate the note with provider's rationale for guideline exceptions (AJ); and performance feedback that benchmarks providers' own performance to that of their peers (PC, for Peer Comparisons).

The outcomes of interest are antibiotic prescribing patterns, including prescribing rates and changes in prescribing rates over time.

The intervention period will be over one year, with a one-year follow up period to measure persistence of the effect after EHR features are returned to the original state and providers no longer receive email alerts.","Inclusion Criteria:

Highly contagious, it is potentially serious and even fatal in infants under 6 months of age. The immunity acquired through vaccination is very limited in time, requiring regular booster shots. There is a passive protection of the newborn by the maternal-fetal transmission of maternal antibodies, but it is brief. The infant's first vaccination is given at 2 months of age and immunity is not acquired until the second injection at 4 months of age. The booster at 11 months of age is essential to prolong this immunity.

In order to protect infants under 6 months of age, France has recommended since 2004 the cocooning strategy, which consists of vaccinating people likely to be in close contact with the infant during this period. This vaccination is therefore proposed to adults who are planning to have children, to the entourage of pregnant women, and in the immediate post-partum period for the mother (and people who were not vaccinated during pregnancy). This strategy was put in place following the international recommendation of a forum of scientific experts, the Global Pertussis Initiative.

In France, vaccination against pertussis is not currently recommended during pregnancy. There is no contraindication to vaccination during pregnancy and it is recommended in many countries.

Influenza is a viral respiratory infection caused by Myxovirus influenzae, which is highly contagious.

In France, vaccination against influenza is recommended for pregnant women, regardless of the trimester of pregnancy. It is also recommended for the entourage of infants under 6 months of age with risk factors for severe influenza.

There are few recent data in the scientific literature regarding influenza and pertussis vaccination coverage among pregnant or postpartum women in France. In addition, the COVID19 pandemic has recently reopened the debate on vaccination of the general population and caregivers. Knowing the current status of vaccination coverage among pregnant women and caregivers, their knowledge and fears regarding vaccination could help improve the information provided by healthcare staff.","Inclusion Criteria:

* To evaluate the proportion of confirmed pertussis cases in infants presenting whooping cough syndrome (WP1a)
* To evaluate the proportion of confirmed pertussis cases or healthy carriers among contact cases
* To determine origin of the infant's contamination (WP1b)
* To determine the duration of protection induced by the wP vaccines used in contact cases and the child population aged 3 to 15 yo (WP1b and WP2)
* To bring new scientific evidences documenting the potential need for initiating boosters (WP1b and WP2)
* To allow a comparison of the results with those obtained using the same methodology for the acellular pertussis vaccine and/or in other contexts. Potential implications for the use of pertussis vaccines in low and moderate income countries.
* To increase local capabilities by the transfer of materials and expertise that will make the diagnosis of pertussis possible in the centres of reference and strengthen a pertussis monitoring network in the implicated countries.

Building upon Uganda's growing mHealth infrastructure to pilot a scalable short message service (SMS) system to remind caregivers of their children's upcoming vaccination visits, it was hypothesized that the SMS intervention will increase immunization coverage in a cost-effective and affordable manner that would make it scalable. The study design was an investigator-blinded, multi-center, parallel groups randomized controlled trial with randomization occurring at the caregiver level in select health facilities of Arua District in Uganda. Enrollment took place at the time of Pentavalent 1 vaccination, and both arms included standard of care provided by the health worker. However, in the intervention arm, caregivers also received SMS text messages reminding them to return for their children's second and third doses of Pentavalent vaccine (four and eight weeks after the first dose of Pentavalent vaccine) and measles-containing vaccine (9 months of age). The primary outcome of interest is vaccination coverage at 12 months of age among children enrolled in the study and will be measured by comparing Penta3 and MCV coverage between arms. The study will also examine the SMS impact on timeliness of vaccine receipt, as it is hypothesized that those children receiving the SMS intervention will be more likely to have timely vaccination than those in the control group. The study will also assess caregiver acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the SMS intervention. In addition to assessing its impact on strengthening the immunization program, this intervention has implications for strengthening other programs of the health system through similar health messaging directed toward caregivers.","Inclusion Criteria:

The current vaccines and vaccination programs do not guarantee protection of neonates. During the last weeks of pregnancy, maternal IgG antibodies are transferred actively to the fetus. Administration of a pertussis containing vaccine during pregnancy offers protection through high titers of maternal antibodies transferred to the child. Since transplacental transport is immature, infants who are born prior to 37 weeks of gestation, might be vulnerable to pertussis infection even though maternal vaccination was administered, but specific data are lacking. The primary aim of this observational study is to measure whether vaccination during pregnancy offers protection to preterm born infants through higher titers of maternal antibodies, despite immature transplacental transport. Four cohorts of mother-infant pairs will be recruited: term versus preterm born infants, born from either vaccinated women or not vaccinated women. These mother-infant pairs are recruited according to the vaccination status of the mother and to the gestational age at delivery. Pertussis specific antibody titers (anti-Pertussis Toxin, anti-Filamentous haemagglutinin, anti-Pertactin titers) will be monitored in blood samples of the mothers at delivery to measure the possible influence of both gestational age and maternal vaccination status. In order to measure the decline of maternal antibodies in the first weeks of life, blood will be taken from cords as well as from infants at 8 weeks of age, before the first infant pertussis vaccine is administered.

Pertussis antibodies to the same antigens will be measured in all infants after a primary series of acellular pertussis vaccines administered at 8,12 and 16 weeks of age and before and after a booster dose in the second year of life.

In addition, cellular mediated immune responses will be evaluated in a subgroup of infants before and after a primary series of infants vaccines. A last goal is to measure whether vaccination during pregnancy could offer additional maternal antibodies through breast milk. Again a comparison is made between preterm and term born infants, born from either vaccinated or unvaccinated women. The amount of lactoferrin and pertussis toxin specific IgA in breast milk samples will be measured in samples taken at birth (colostrum), and at several time points afterwards as long as breastfeeding is continued.","Inclusion Criteria for participating women:

This policy is designed so that all babies are protected as early as possible from vaccine preventable diseases such as polio, diphtheria, tetanus, rotavirus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type B, pneumococcal disease and now meningococcal B disease. The 4CMenB vaccination (Bexsero®) was added to the UK schedule in September 2015 and there has been no research looking at whether the vaccine gives the same protection to babies born early as it does to those born at term. The Investigators want to compare two different schedules of 4CMenB and see if one gives better protection to babies born prematurely. It is possible that an extra 4CMenB dose (i.e. three doses in early infancy instead of two) will offer better protection for premature babies.

* Does longer KMC decrease the incidence of postpartum depression in mothers of low birthweight infants in a low-resource setting?
* Does longer KMC improve neurodevelopmental outcomes of low birthweight infants at 6, 12, and 18 months in a low-resource setting?
* What are the barriers to practicing KMC in low birthweight infants following hospital discharge in a low-resource setting?
* What is the prevalence of paternal depression in a low resource setting?
* Is it cost effective to admit preterm mother-infant dyads to the KMC ward following NICU discharge?

Furthermore, these populations represent a reservoir of the infectious agent from which the dissemination to non-immune infants is possible, causing severe illness, or even death, in this age group.

Few studies have been carried out on whooping cough in developing countries (incidence, contaminator's age, etc.) and, specifically, none have assessed the duration of protection induced by the whole cell pertussis (wP) vaccine mainly presently used in these countries.

However, data on the duration of vaccine induced protection are essential to determine i) the usefulness of vaccine boosters and ii) the target age group for these boosters.

The aims of the present study are:

* To evaluate the proportion of confirmed pertussis cases in infants presenting whooping cough syndrome (WP1a)
* To evaluate the proportion of confirmed pertussis cases or healthy carriers among contact cases
* To determine origin of the infant's contamination (WP1b)
* To determine the duration of protection induced by the wP vaccines used in contact cases and the child population aged 3 to 15 yo (WP1b and WP2)
* To bring new scientific evidences documenting the potential need for initiating boosters (WP1b and WP2)
* To allow a comparison of the results with those obtained using the same methodology for the acellular pertussis vaccine and/or in other contexts. Potential implications for the use of pertussis vaccines in low and moderate income countries.
* To increase local capabilities by the transfer of materials and expertise that will make the diagnosis of pertussis possible in the centres of reference and strengthen a pertussis monitoring network in the implicated countries.
* To improve children's health through a better match of the vaccination schedule according to the reality of the situation.","Inclusion Criteria:

The researchers want to understand whether all women have the same access to urgent and emergency maternity care, and whether there are differences in health outcomes for mothers and babies who use ambulance services.

The study has two parts (called Work-Packages):

Work Package One will look at data from women who were taken by ambulance to a Manchester University National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust (MFT) maternity unit during the perinatal period, compared with those who had a baby at MFT but were not taken there by ambulance. It will look at the differences between the two groups and their health outcomes.

Work Package Two will look closely at the text written by paramedics within ambulance records for some women from Work Package One, especially those at increased risk of a poor outcome. The researchers will study what happened during their care journey and look for anything that happens repeatedly within the text to better understand their experiences.

By combining the results from both work packages, the study aims to give a detailed picture of how different women access emergency maternity care and outcomes for themselves and their babies. This will help identify ways to improve services, especially for women who may face barriers to getting the care they need, helping to make sure that maternity care is safe, fair, and more effective for everyone.","Work Package 1

Prelicensure studies and post marketing surveillance data showed that 4CMenB has a high reactogenicity especially when coadministered with other infant routine vaccines \[1-2\]. While this suggests that coadministration causes an interaction resulting in a greater risk of adverse events following Immunization (AEFI) only the AEFI after the 4CMenB dose and not those occurring after routine vaccine immunizations were reported, underestimating the total risk associated with immunization at separate visits. For financial and practical reasons, coadministration of infant vaccines is preferred to separate visits. Separate visits may however be preferred if the sum of the AEFI risk at each visit is significantly smaller than the risk with coadministration and/or if the AEFI has a lesser severity. The purpose of this study is to recalculate the risk of occurrence and severity of AEFI with the coadministration of Bexsero™ and routine vaccines compared to separate injections to assess the interaction occurring with co-administration. Investigators will also estimate the risk of recurrence of AEFI at subsequent immunizations with the 4CMenB and assess if this risk varies with separate or coadministration with routine vaccines. To achieve these purposes, investigators will perform a secondary analysis of the data of three randomized controlled trials (clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: NCT00657709, NCT00847145 and NCT00721396) that evaluated 5025 children aged 2 to 14 months of whom 4535 were randomized to receive 3 to 4 doses of 4CMenB concomitantly or alternatively with routine vaccinations (DTaP-Inactivated polio virus -HepatitisB/Haemophilus influenzae type b \[Infanrix Hexa™\], Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 7 valent \[Prevenar™\] or Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella vaccine \[Priorix-Tetra™\]) \[1,2\].","Inclusion Criteria:

These developments, along with the introduction in clinical practice of technological innovations, such as telemedicine, telemonitoring, and remote screening, are considered essential elements of ""game-changing innovations"" in the next 25 years. In fact, the widespread distribution of networked devices, which are estimated to reach 29.3 billion in 2023, offers a promising but challenging opportunity of mHealth use for health information seeking, with an important role in health behavior formation. In 2017, more than 325,000 mobile health applications (apps) were available worldwide, and among them, to the best of our knowledge, there were more apps available to support pregnancy than for any other medical domain. These mobile technologies in support of pregnancy have also increased the possibility for both parents and parents-to-be to self-manage health issues; findings from a recent study conducted in 2019 in Switzerland report that 91% of parents declared using digital media for seeking information about their child's health and development. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis showed that social media and mHealth have the potential to be effective in promoting maternal physical health (e.g., weight management), mental health, and knowledge about pregnancy. However, when considering apps addressing children's first 1000 days of life, from conception through age 24 months, many of them just focus on the prenatal or postnatal stage, failing to consider the continuity between the two phases and their joint impact on maternal and child health.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mHealth App effectiveness for the support of women during the first 1000 days (from conception through age 24 months) and for improving health prevention behaviors such as vaccination during pregnancy, weight increment during pregnancy, abstinence from smoke and alcohol consumption habits, adherence to child routine vaccination schedule.

It can affect people of all ages, however young unimmunised or partially immunised infants are the most vulnerable group with the highest rates of complications and death. Recent surveillance data and an increase in the number of pertussis outbreaks being reported nationally, indicate an increase in the incidence of pertussis disease in South Africa.To date there is no data on the effect of vaccinating HIV-infected pregnant women with pertussis-containing vaccines, although there is no reason to think that vaccinating these women would be harmful for them or their foetus.

Antibiotic use in the first weeks of life can lower the levels of beneficial gut bacteria, such as bifidobacteria, which play a key role in immune function. As a result, infants treated with antibiotics may produce fewer antibodies after routine vaccinations, leaving them less protected against infections.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

* Does treatment with the probiotic Infloran® improve the geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of anticapsular antibodies against at least 11 serotypes included in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) in serum samples collected at 6 months of age compared with placebo in infants treated with antibiotics in the neonatal period?
* Does treatment with the probiotic Infloran® improve the GMCs for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) at 12 months of age compared with placebo in infants treated with antibiotics in the neonatal period?
* Does treatment with the probiotic Infloran® improve the GMCs of other routine childhood vaccines at 6 and 12 months of age compared with placebo in infants treated with antibiotics in the neonatal period?
* Does treatment with the probiotic Infloran® increase the proportion of infants achieving seroprotective antibody levels for pneumococcal antigens compared to placebo in infants treated with antibiotics in the neonatal period?
* What are the differences in antigen specific T cell responses, flow cytometry, blood transcriptomics, and gut microbiota composition in the probiotic (Infloran®) vs placebo groups in infants treated with antibiotics in the neonatal period?

Researchers will compare infants who receive Infloran® (a probiotic containing Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidphilus) with those who receive a placebo (which contains the same excipients as Infloran® but does not contain any bacterial strains).

Participants will:

* Be randomly assigned to receive either a 14-day course of probiotic Infloran® or a placebo.
* Provide blood samples (3-5 mL) at 6 weeks, 6.5 weeks (optional blood-draw for exploratory endpoint), 6 months and 12 months of age.
* Provide stool samples at four timepoints: prior to starting the intervention (probiotic/placebo), on day 7, on day 14 after completion of the study supplement, and prior to their first vaccination at 6 weeks of age.
* Receive routine vaccinations at 6 weeks, 4 months and 6 months in line with the National Immunisation Program
* Complete surveys to collect information regarding probiotic/placebo administration and vaccination related side effects

This study aims to recruit 360 infants to assess whether this probiotic treatment following antibiotic exposure improves the immunogenicity of vaccinations. The information from this study will improve our understanding of how probiotic intervention can support optimal immune responses to vaccination in early life. The findings could potentially influence public health strategies, offering a new way to support optimal vaccine responses in antibiotic-treated infants.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT03000543,"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh",Novel Isotope Dilution Technique to Assess Vitamin A Status,Validation of a Novel Isotope Dilution Technique to Assess Vitamin A Status in Infants,COMPLETED,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"Healthy Infants, Infants With an Inflammatory Condition",250,2016-11-01,2019-06-30,Vitamin A pool size in infants with or without inflammation,"Background:

There is no reliable method for vitamin A (VA) assessment for infants and young children. Serum VA concentration is not an authenticate indicator of VA status, while existing deuterium- VA isotope dilution methods to determine the whole body VA status require 3 weeks and not applicable for infants and children. The investigator's research group recently developed a new simplified equation to measure VA pool size in 4-5 days, correlated with compartmental model-predicted value and estimate VA pool size in adults with high precision. In this study, we validate the method in healthy infants and infants with an inflammatory condition.

Hypothesis:

Whole-body VA status in infant and children can be estimated without accounting for the fractional catabolic rate in the context of an inflammatory condition

Specific Objectives:

In this study, the investigators propose to determine the early time point equation for assessing VA pool size in infants with or without inflammatory condition using model-based compartmental analysis from the fraction of oral dose-derived 13C10-VA and 13C4-VA in plasma over time.

Methods:

A total of 183 infants (9-18 mo of age) will participate in this study in the following two phases of the ""Super Kid study"" that ensure no more than 2 venous blood samples from each infant, even though multiple time points (at least 4 subjects / time-point) over a 28-day study period will be available for mathematical modeling. In this study, investigators will use two different stable isotopic vitamin A e.g., 13C10-retinyl acetate and 13C4-retinyl acetate. 400 μg of these isotopes, dissolved in 0.5 mL of sunflower oil, will be provided directly into the infant's mouth by using a direct replacement pipette. Mothers will be asked to breastfeed their infant after oral dosing to enhance absorption of the labeled vitamin A. Specific activity of 13C10- and 13C4- retinyl acetate in the blood samples will be measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Dietary and morbidity questionnaires will be used. Investigators will also use PENTA vaccines as a means to induce controlled inflammation (closely mimic to natural infection). PENTA is a combination of five different vaccine antigens (Hepatitis B (HBV)/ Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) / Tetanus-Diphtheria-whole cell Pertussis (TDwP)). This vaccination is beneficial to the infants since the World Health Organization recommends a booster vaccination dose. At the end of the study, PENTA vaccines will also be provided to the study infants in the ""no-vaccine"" group.

(A) 115 infants will be enrolled randomly into 16 groups of them 40 infants will be in the first group, while other infants will be assigned in the other 15 groups (n=5/group). On day 0 (at 0h), all infants (n=115) will receive an oral dose of 13C10-retinyl acetate. Blood samples (5 mL) will be taken from 6h to 16th day of dosing at 9 different time-points. On day 16 (at 0h), randomly selected 50% infants (n=20) in the first group, as well as 30 infants in the other 6 groups, will receive PENTA vaccines, while the other 50% infants (n=20) in the first Group, as well as 45 infants in the other 9 groups, will receive no vaccines. 24 hours after vaccination (On day 17) a finger-prick blood sample will be obtained from the infants in the vaccinated group to measure CRP (QuikRead go, Orion, Finland). Infants who do not develop inflammation (CRP\> 5mg/L) after PENTA vaccination will be excluded from the study. On day 17 (at 0h), all infants (n=115) will receive another oral dose of 13C4-retinyl acetate. Blood samples (5mL) will be collected from day 16 to day 28 at 11 different time-points for each of the vaccinated and non-vaccinated infants. This study will also assess the absorption of isotopic retinol by determining in total excreted stool up to 72 h post isotope dosing in a subsample of infants

(B) 68 infants will be enrolled in this phase. Of them, 28 infants will be assigned randomly into 7 groups (n=4/group). They will receive PENTA vaccines on day -1, and the next day (day 0) they will receive an oral dose of 13C4-retinyl acetate. Blood samples (5mL) will be collected from day 1 to day 28 at 8 different time points. In a separate design, 40 infants will receive an oral dose of 13C10-retinyl acetate on day 0 and blood samples (5mL) will be collected on day 4. On day 7 they all will receive another oral dose of 13C4-retinyl acetate (400 μg, dissolved in 0.5 mL of sunflower oil). On day 10, infants will receive PENTA vaccines (n=30) or no vaccine (n=10) and 1-day after vaccination, blood samples (5 mL) will be obtained from infants who develop inflammation (CRP\> 5mg/L) in the vaccine group and also from infants in the control group (day 11).

However, the beginning of the vaccination of these children is often postponed and the vaccination schedule little followed.Concerning the vaccination of premature children, the national recommendations of the High Council of Public Health (HCSP) are different from those of the French experts in pediatric vaccinology. The HCSP recommends a vaccination schedule beginning at the age of 8 weeks postnatal, including, as for full-term infants, two injections at 2-month intervals of vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, haemophilus influenzae B type, whooping cough and hepatitis B. Anti-pneumococcal vaccination is recommended at 2, 3 and 4 months of life.

The French experts of the Infectious Pediatric Pathology Group (GPIP) of the French Pediatric Society recommend a primary vaccination against whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus Influenzae B (DTPCoqHIB) and hepatitis B at 2, 3 and 4 months for children born before 33 weeks of amenorrhea (WA), and at 2 and 4 months for those born between 33 and 36 weeks + 6 days. Primary anti-pneumococcal vaccination is recommended at 2, 3 and 4 months for all children born prematurely before 37WA.

On the other hand, the cocooning vaccination of the parents against whooping cough is recommended in case of birth at term as of premature birth. This cocooning strategy has not been sufficiently applied, justifying a recall in 2008 for all adults who have not received pertussis vaccination during the last ten years.

The investigators seek to evaluate the follow-up of the recommended vaccination schedule of premature children leaving Angers University Hospital and the reasons associated with the non-monitoring of the calendar in order to identify possible lines of work to improve immunization compliance.","Inclusion Criteria:

Most coughs are caused by self-limiting viral infections such as the common cold. However, 1 in 4 people with a viral infection develop a persistent cough, which can go on for several weeks. Whooping cough is a common cause of persistent cough in young people and adults. Although the whooping cough vaccine gives lifelong protection against severe infection, it does not appear to give such long-term protection against milder infections, which can make someone cough for many weeks. There are currently no proven efficacious treatments for persistent cough following either a viral infection or infection with whooping cough.

Montelukast is a medication which is already licensed for the treatment of asthma. It works by blocking the action of chemicals called leukotrienes, which make the airways of people with asthma inflamed and sensitive. There is strong evidence to suggest that leukotrienes are also involved in causing persistent cough following viral or whooping cough infection. Montelukast may therefore also help settle persistent coughs in these settings.

Over 18 months, we will recruit patients aged 16-49 years with a cough lasting 2-8 weeks from general practices in England. An oral fluid sample will be taken from each participant to be tested for whooping cough. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive a 28-day course of montelukast or placebo tablets and asked to complete a daily cough diary for two weeks. They will be assessed after two weeks by their GP (face-to-face) and after four weeks by another member of practice clinical staff (telephone).

Live BCG vaccine can train the immune system and reduce susceptibility to unrelated infections. In contrast, non-live diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing (DTP) vaccine enhances susceptibility in females: DTP vs no DTP is associated with 2-fold higher mortality, and in DTP-vaccinated children, females have higher mortality than males. These effects are seen as long as a vaccine is the most recent vaccine. WHO recommends BCG at birth followed by three DTP vaccines. A metaanalysis based on observational studies has shown that co-administration of BCG+DTP is associated with lower mortality than BCG followed by DTP.

An estimated 20% of children in the developing world are malnourished \[1\] and poor nutrition is linked to more than half of all child deaths worldwide \[2\]. Malnutrition in early childhood may lead to cognitive and physical deficits and may cause similar deficits in future generations as malnourished mothers give birth to low birth weight children \[3\]. In addition, malnutrition increases susceptibility and incidence of infections and is associated with diminished response to vaccines.

The MAL-ED Project is designed to determine the impact of enteric infections/diarrhea that alter gut function and impair children's nutrition, growth and development to help develop new intervention strategies that can break the vicious enteric infection-malnutrition cycle and reduce its global burden.

The overall objective of the MAL-ED Project is to quantify the associations of specific enteric pathogens, measures of physical and mental development, micronutrient malnutrition, gut function biomarkers, the gut microbiome, and immune responses in very young children in resource-limited settings across eight sites that vary by culture, economics, geography, and climate.

The central hypothesis of the MAL-ED Project is that infection (and co-infection) with specific enteropathogens leads to impaired growth and development and to diminished immune response to orally administered vaccines by causing intestinal inflammation and/or by altering intestinal barrier and absorptive function. Data analyses will test for associations between enteropathogen infections and growth/development to help illuminate:

* which micro-organisms or mixed infections are most frequently associated with growth faltering and poor development; and
* at what age specific infections cause the most disruption to growth and development and impair immune response.","Inclusion Criteria:

Primary study cohort

The primary study cohort will include all infants from SCKP who have begun their primary course of vaccine with PEDIARIX co-administered with Prevnar and for whom at least one dose of PEDIARIX was administered prior to the infant's 9-month birthday and safety follow-up information is available.

Control cohorts

Three control cohorts will be evaluated.

1. The historical cohort will include age-, gender- and area-matched infants from SCKP who received at least one dose of DTaP vaccine co-administered with Prevnar prior to the infant's 9-month birthday and for whom safety follow-up information is available. This cohort will include infants vaccinated between January, 2002 and March, 2003.
2. The self-control cohort is defined for the study subject as the 20-day post-vaccination period from Day 21 to Day 41 for each infant in the primary cohort (PEDIARIX co-administered with Prevnar as the primary vaccination course).
3. The ""delayed PEDIARIX use clinic"" cohort will include all infants from SCKP who, during the enrollment period for the primary cohort, began their primary course of vaccination with DTaP vaccine and for whom at least one dose of DTaP vaccine was co-administered with Prevnar prior to the infant's 9-month birthday and safety follow-up information is available. The size of this cohort will depend on how quickly individual SCKP clinics and medical centers use PEDIARIX once it is made available. The size of this cohort, therefore, is not immediately predictable.

Three of the four African trials were conducted by the Bandim Health Project (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau. One of them was a two-by-two factorial trial among low-birth-weight children. From 2004-2008, the children were randomly allocated to 25,000 IU vitamin A or placebo at birth, and furthermore to BCG vaccination at birth or later as is local policy. In 2011, the investigators conducted a follow-up study. A remarkably strong harmful effect of NVAS on atopy and wheezing was found (manuscript under review).

Seen in the context that NVAS may soon become a WHO policy it is obviously worrying if NVAS is associated with a higher risk of atopy and wheezing. The investigators therefore aim to conduct a similar follow-up study of participants in the first NVAS trial conducted in Guinea-Bissau from 2002-2004, among normal-birth-weight infants, to test whether NVAS is associated with an increased risk of atopy and wheezing and other allergic symptoms as well as growth.

METHODS

Study population:

From 2002-2004 BHP conducted a randomised trial of NVAS. The investigators recruited newborns when they came for BCG vaccination. Provided parental consent, they received an oral supplement of 50,000 IU vitamin A or placebo.

Study design:

This study will be a follow-up study of the cohort of children randomised to NVAS (intervention) or placebo (current policy) together with BCG vaccine at birth.

Other exposures:

The investigators will also investigate the effect of receiving an additional dose of measles vaccine and the timing of DTP vaccine on the development of atopy.

Assessment of outcomes:

The investigators will visit all children at the last known address. Height, weight and mid upper arm circumference will be measured. BCG scar will be examined and vaccination card details recorded by the field assistant. Children will be excluded from skin prick testing (SPT) if they have a history suggestive of anaphylaxis or are currently using anti-histamine medication. SPT will be performed using aero-allergens, food allergens and positive histamine and negative saline control. The mother or guardian will be interviewed by a local assistant. Symptoms of eczema and asthma as well as food allergy will be assessed.

Statistical analysis:

Effect of randomisation group and other factors on outcomes will be analysed in multivariable regression models. All analyses will be adjusted for skin prick tester. All analyses will be conducted stratified by sex.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Enrolled at birth in NCT00168610

Uncertainty in the clinical and etiological diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) often leads to incorrect treatment and unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Establishing the clinical diagnosis of CAP is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity of chest radiograph to detect pulmonary infiltrates (\~70%). Establishing the etiological diagnosis is also hampered, mainly because of the inevitable diagnostic delays and low sensitivity of routine microbiological tests. There are currently no recommendations for low-dose chest computed tomography (low-dose CT) or viral and bacterial point-of-care multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PoC-PCR) in the diagnostic work-up of CAP patients, because the data supporting such an approach are lacking.

Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the added value of low-dose CT and PoC-PCR in the diagnostic workup of patients with CAP hospitalised to non-intensive care unit (ICU) wards in minimizing selective antibiotic pressure while maintaining patient safety.

Study design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial with historical control period.

Study population: Adult patients (\>=18 years old) with a clinical diagnosis of CAP requiring hospitalisation to a non-ICU ward.

Intervention: Intervention arm 1: availability of PoC-PCR during the ER visit; intervention arm 2: performing low-dose CT from the ER or at least within 24 hours; control arm: standard care.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary effectiveness outcome is days of therapy of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The primary safety outcome, on which the sample size is calculated, is 90-day all-cause mortality.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: There are no risks associated with performing the PoC-PCR and the radiation of the low-dose CT is of negligible risk. Nasopharyngeal swab collection causes a temporary unpleasant sensation. The low-dose CT can reveal unexpected findings which may require additional diagnostic procedures, for which the treating physician will use state-of-the-art guidelines. Treatment recommendations to de-escalate or stop antibiotic treatment may be beneficial for the individual patient by minimising exposure to antibiotics and improve targeted use of antibiotics. Final decisions are always made by the treating physician taking into account all clinical information.","Inclusion Criteria:

One possible way to protect the mother and young infant from RSV infection is a vaccine given to women during pregnancy (maternal vaccination), which would pass protection to their unborn child. This may help to prevent RSV in the child's first few months of life when they are most vulnerable to infection.

There are two main aims to this study:

1. To pre-emptively gauge the knowledge of RSV and potential acceptability of such vaccines amongst pregnant women and healthcare staff working in midwifery and obstetrics, as well as their attitudes (facilitators and barriers) to being involved in hypothetical future research trials.
2. We also wish to gauge the attitudes to routinely recommended vaccines in pregnancy (pertussis and influenza)

The investigators propose to undertake a questionnaire-based study of randomly selected pregnant women and healthcare staff (over 16 years of age) at English teaching hospitals and GP practices. Pregnant women attending for ward reviews or antenatal clinics will approached and asked to complete an anonymous paper questionnaire lasting around 10 minutes. Healthcare staff will be approached in person, or via email, and asked to complete a slightly different questionnaire lasting around 5-10 minutes. No follow up will take place. Using statistical software, the investigators hope to identify factors that might affect patients' understanding of RSV and attitudes to being involved in hypothetical future trials and receiving routine vaccination","1.

Lack of knowledge was the leading reason for non-vaccination. To overcome this knowledge gap, this project, ""Tunatar da ni"", will deliver targeted text messages to community leaders and individualized text messages to parents and caregivers in Kebbi state, Northwest Nigeria, a state with very low coverage of immunization (19% penta 3 coverage in 2018).

These text messages, also known as Short Messaging System (SMS) messages will be managed, scheduled and sent from a purpose-built, cloud-based Immunization Reminder and Information SMS System (IRISS). The messages will be deployed in three ways, as:

1. General broadcast of messages on the importance of immunization to all active mobile phone subscribers in the intervention area.
2. Targeted educational, informational, normative and motivational messages on immunization, and reminders on the local immunization clinic schedules, to community members who voluntarily registered into IRISS for these messages, and to traditional and religious leaders who then share these information with their communities.
3. Individualized reminders of a child's immunization due dates and local clinic schedule to parents who voluntarily registered their child's information on IRISS in order to receive these reminders.

Study investigators hypothesize that providing community leaders with positive and actionable messages on immunization services will improve their understanding of the value of vaccines and provide them facts to drive discussions, build positive norms and increase acceptance of vaccination. Providing targeted reminders to parents about their child's vaccination due date and the schedule of their local vaccination clinics will motivate their timely action to seek vaccination services for their children.

Intervention will be evaluated using a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial design. All 21 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Kebbi state will be involved. Based on a 2:1 ratio, 14 LGAs will be randomly assigned to receive the SMS intervention while 7 LGAs will serve as controls.

The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of children aged 0-11 months who are appropriately vaccinated for age. The data to compare this outcome between the intervention and control arms, will be obtained from the quarterly lot quality assurance surveys done by the Nigerian government.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT02490007,Telethon Kids Institute,Pertussis Immunisation and Food Allergy,Case-control Study of the Association Between Pertussis Vaccination in Infancy and the Risk of IgE-mediated Food Allergy,COMPLETED,OBSERVATIONAL,,Food Allergy,508,2015-10,2018-12,Diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy,"Aim To assess the possible food allergy-preventive benefit of using whole cell pertussis(wP) vaccination compared with acelluar pertussis vaccine(aP) for whooping cough vaccination in childhood.

Background Whooping cough, caused by the bacteria, Bordetella pertussis, represents a significant public health burden in Australia and around the world. Acellular pertussis vaccination (aP) replaced whole cell vaccination against pertussis (wP) in the late 1990s. This replacement coincides temporally in an observed rapid rise in the occurrence of severe food allergy responses. Previous research has suggested that acellular pertussis vaccination results in the development of immunity that may predispose children to allergic responses. A retrospective case-controlled trial design, targeting cases of previously diagnosed allergy, and comparing case vaccination history to that of the whole population, is a powerful means of assessing the association between immunisation and allergy.

Participant Groups 1000 allergy cases, 10,000 controls

Project Design This is a retrospective individually-matched case-control study of Australian children born during the period of transition from use of wP vaccines to aP vaccines (year of birth 1997-1999 inclusive) and who are registered on the Australian Children Immunisation Register. Cases will be drawn from allergy clinics associated with tertiary teaching hospitals around Australia.

Methods Cases: will be retrospectively identified from patient lists from allergy clinics around Australia, born during the period of pertussis vaccine changeover, and be confirmed to have IgE-mediated food allergy on the basis of 1) a documented history of consistent clinical symptoms following ingestion of an implicated food, and 2) evidence of sensitisation to that food via laboratory testing.

Controls: Controls will be sampled from a de-identified database of children born during the transition from wP to aP vaccination appearing on the ACIR. Cases and controls will be matched by date of birth (+/-7 days), jurisdiction and socioeconomic decile.

Expected outcomes: Following the study, investigators will be able determine if there is an association between the type of vaccination received and development of IgE mediated food allergy. If whole cell vaccination is found to have a protective association against the development of allergy, this will have profound impact on health policy in Australia and around the world.","Eligibility Criteria

1\. All cases and controls must be registered on ACIR as having had a first dose of any pertussis containing vaccine before age 16 weeks and during the period of time in which the transition between aP and wP vaccine occurred; birth dates within 1st Janurary 1997 and 31st December 1999 depending on the jurisdiction.

Case Inclusion Criteria- Cases will be considered to have IgE-mediated food allergy on the basis of

1. a documented history of consistent clinical symptoms following ingestion of an implicated food, and
2. evidence of sensitisation to that food via either positive skin-prick test or elevated specific IgE to the implicated food, with onset after the first pertussis-containing vaccine but before age 15 years.

IgE-mediated food allergy is defined as BOTH:

1. The clinical notes or clinical letter arising from the allergy consult must explicitly document the presence of one or more of the following features. Onset of at least one these features must be within 1 hour of ingestion of suspected food where this can reasonably inferred from statements such as ""immediate"", ""within x mins"" where x is \<60:

   * urticaria
   * angioedema
   * emesis
   * vocal hoarseness
   * persistent cough
   * wheeze
   * stridor
   * collapse
   * hypotension

   AND
2. Documented evidence of allergic sensitisation to the implicated food through EITHER:

   * specific IgE positive (serum specific IgE \>0.35KU/l) to suspected food ), OR
   * positive skin prick test (wheal diameter \>3mm) against suspected food (SPT) Evidence of sensitisation must be at the time of consultation or the 6 months after the clinical encounter for the case to meet definition.

TB's estimated incidence in Africa has been declining over recent years but progress is slow and plateauing. To avert stagnation, truly innovative and ambitious technologies are needed, especially those that improve case finding and time-to-diagnosis as, in mathematical models based on the TB care cascade framework, interventions that accomplish this will have the most impact on disrupting population-level transmission, including when deployed at facilities where patients are readily accessible. Critically, these interventions (triage tests) must promote access to confirmatory testing (e.g., Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) by enabling patients to be referred rapidly and efficiently during the same visit. The investigators will optimise and evaluate a technology that, aside from the investigators early case-controlled study to show feasibility, is hitherto not meaningfully investigated for TB. This gap is alarming given, on one hand, the enormity of the TB epidemic and the need for a triage test and, on the other hand, promising proofs-of-concept that demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy of cough audio classifier for respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, asthma. pertussis, croup, and COPD. In some cases, these classification systems are CE-marked, awaiting FDA-approval, and subject to late-stage clinical trials. This demonstrates the promise of the underlying technological principle. CAGE-TB's innovation is further enhanced by: applying advanced machine learning methods that the team have specifically developed for TB patient cough audio analysis, use of mixed methods research - drawing from health economics, implementation science, and medical anthropology - to inform product design and assess barriers and facilitators to implementation, and uniquely for a TB diagnostic test, its potential deployment as a pure mHealth (smartphone-based) innovation that mitigates many barriers that typically jeopardise TPP criteria fulfilment.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Preventive vaccines against other infections. Preventive vaccines prevent a person from getting a disease. Preventive vaccines have been developed for many diseases, including, for example, whooping cough, measles, mumps, influenza, and hepatitis B. Some preventive vaccines may also prevent a disease from taking hold if given immediately after infection, such as vaccines for rabies, smallpox and hepatitis.
* Therapeutic vaccines against HIV. Therapeutic vaccines are intended to treat someone who has already been infected, with the goal of controlling the disease or preventing it from causing severe illness. As yet, there are no therapeutic vaccines for any diseases.
* Vaccines against other infections. Vaccines to prevent other infections besides HIV may need to be tested separately in people with HIV infection because the immune system works differently when HIV infection is present.

HIV-infected patients 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this screening study. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding may not participate.

Participants will be screened with the following:

* A health history, including questions about sexual activity and drug use;
* Physical examination, including blood and urine tests;
* HIV testing to confirm HIV infection;
* Pregnancy test for premenopausal women;
* PPD test for tuberculosis for those who have not been tested in the previous 6 months.

Candidates who meet the requirements for investigational vaccine studies will be invited to participate in a study. Those who do not begin a study within 1 month of the screening tests may need to repeat some tests for continued consideration. In addition, some studies require repeated measures of CD4 counts and viral load over a period of a few months.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

About one in ten babies with GBS infection die and half of babies with GBS meningitis are left with long term problems with their development.

Vaccinating pregnant women against GBS in order to protect their newborn babies is a promising area of research.However, many women are reluctant to accept vaccination during pregnancy for fear it will harm their unborn child and there is often a lack of understanding of both the vaccine and the condition it aims to prevent. Nevertheless, the recent positive experience of immunisation against pertussis in the United Kingdom, suggest that antenatal immunisation can be acceptable.

Previous research has shown that advice from maternity healthcare professionals regarding vaccination is highly valued by pregnant women so it is also important to explore the attitudes and opinions of this group.

The objective of this study is to assess the knowledge and attitudes of pregnant women and maternity healthcare professionals in England and Scotland regarding GBS disease and the acceptability of a potential vaccine.

There are two parts to this study. The first part will invite pregnant women, maternity healthcare professionals and parents who have had a child affected by GBS disease to take part in either a focus group or an individual interview.

This will allow for an in-depth exploration of the participants thoughts and opinions about GBS and vaccination in pregnancy. This part of the study will take place at the Oxford site only. The results will guide the development of a self completed, paper questionnaire which will be distributed to a wider range of pregnant women and maternity healthcare professionals across four different study sites.

Little is known about the mechanisms involved in the clinical variability of pertussis, including its most severe malignant form observed in infants (mortality between 50-80%). The main challenges are: (i) the lack of knowledge about the gene expression of B. pertussis strains currently circulating during human infection, incorporating evolutionary changes and vaccine-induced selective pressure; (ii) the poor understanding of the variability in clinical expression of pertussis, and (iii) the lack of biomarkers to predict disease severity or prognosis in infants.

An integrative strategy combining a clinical, microbiological, immunological and 'omic' approach from a prospective cohort of children with pertussis will be used to identify

1. 'in situ' expression profiles of B. pertussis genes and proteins incorporating recent evolutionary changes and
2. a systemic and respiratory immune signature in B. pertussis-infected children according to severity.

Among the most frequent bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract in pediatric age we find acute bacterial pharyngitis or pharyngotonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (β-hemolytic group A), for which antimicrobial therapy is clearly indicated, and which manifests itself with an onset sudden fever. It should also be remembered that some forms of pharyngitis are caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and Legionella, commonly responsible for lower respiratory tract infections but recently also associated with upper respiratory tract infections. In childhood, a viral or bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract (in particular pharyngitis, laryngitis) can easily lead to an infection of the lower respiratory tract (pneumonia). In fact, the inflammatory process triggered by a previous infection, generally viral, determines an impairment of mucociliary clearance which facilitates the proliferation not only of pathogenic bacteria but also of the commensal bacterial flora, normally non-pathogenic. An altered local microbial flora can, therefore, contribute to the pathogenesis of new infections or itself be responsible for invasive infections. The microbiota of the upper airways may therefore be a further factor influencing the susceptibility, frequency and severity of acute respiratory diseases. The oropharyngeal microbiota is in fact made up of numerous bacterial species which, by colonizing this anatomical tract, interact with the mucosa of the pharynx and therefore with the immune system, contributing to the homeostasis of the upper respiratory tract and consequently also preserving the integrity of the lower respiratory tract. As observed for other anatomical sites, the composition of the oropharyngeal microbiota is conditioned by external events, among which we find the use of antibiotics or oral disinfectant drugs which can favor the development of pathogenic microorganisms. Characterizing the oropharyngeal microbiota in a state of acute and/or chronic respiratory infection could increase knowledge on the microbiological signature associated with such infections and ineffective antibiotic treatments. Greater knowledge of it, also with future corrective purposes, as has now been demonstrated for other body areas, could be of great help in reducing the risk of acute recurrent disease and/or chronic consequences.","Inclusion Criteria:

However, this development has also dramatically increased the number of maternally HAART/HIV-exposed-uninfected (HEU) infants in areas of high HIV prevalence. Compared to their HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) counterparts, HEU infants show increased mortality, higher rates of adverse birth outcomes, infectious and non-communicable diseases and impaired growth, immune responses and neurodevelopment. Adverse clinical outcomes and their respective risk factors alongside associated biomarkers of HEU infants in SSA have been insufficiently characterized. Early exposure to HAART and HIV might be risk factors for the adverse outcomes in HEU infants but other potential risk factors and biomarkers remain understudied.

Methods The University of Zimbabwe-College of Health Science birth cohort is a prospective cohort study of perinatal HIV and in utero HAART exposure throughout the breastfeeding period in the era of option B+. 600 HIV infected and 600 HIV uninfected pregnant women ≥20 weeks of gestation are being enrolled from four primary health centres in poor high-density residential areas of Harare. Clinical, socio-demographic/economic, nutritional and environmental data and bio-samples including maternal urine, stool, plasma, milk, cord blood, amniotic fluid as well as infant serum, dried blood spots and stool are being collected at enrolment, delivery and longitudinal follow-ups as mother-infant pairs from delivery, week(s) 1, 6, 10, 14, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 after birth. Infants are being assessed for congenital transmission of HIV, hepatitis B/C viruses, cytomegalovirus, syphilis, and growth, neurodevelopment, and immune-dysregulation. Sub-studies are addressing maternal-infant immunometabolomics, latent tuberculosis infection, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and the effect of maternal stress thereof. The primary end point of this study is infant mortality until two years of age in HEU versus HUU infants. Secondary outcomes include HEU morbidity.

Conclusion Our study will provide a comprehensive assessment of risk factors and associated biomarkers for adverse clinical outcomes for HEU infants and ultimately help developing strategies to mitigate effects of HIV, comorbidities and early life HAART exposure on pregnancy outcome and infant health.

When a person is exposed to something that causes an infection, the body sends a type of cell called CD8 T cells to attack it. Those cells are also found in breast milk. Nursing mothers pass these cells to their child, which helps the child fight infections, too. Researchers want to learn more about how CD8 cells work to keep people healthy.

Objective:

To learn more about how the human body fights off infections.

Eligibility:

People age 18 years and older who either have an infection, are suspected to have an infection, or recently got a vaccine.

The household contacts of these people and people who have not been recently exposed to any infection are also needed.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical and health history and physical exam. They may have blood tests.

The first study visit can be the same day as screening. It can be up to 3 months later. For those visits, screening tests will be repeated.

At the first visit, participants will have blood collected from an arm vein.

Participants who are breastfeeding may provide a small sample of breast milk. They may collect it at home or bring a pumping device to NIH to collect it. NIH can also provide a breast pump.

Participants may be contacted for up to 1 year after the first visit to give samples of blood and/or breast milk.

Up to 4 additional visits, which will each take about 1 hour, may be scheduled.

A personal physician or local lab can collect blood from participants and ship it to NIH. Breast milk cannot be shipped.","-INCLUSION CRITERIA:
